# Broadening Participation in Computing Reading Group

The purpose of this group is self-education on the topic of broadening
participation in computing, with an assumed audience of post-secondary
educators (e.g., faculty, administration, staff, teaching assistants, & future faculty). The meetings serve
a dual purpose of accountability in reading (or watching) the materials and
further engagement through discussion and possible application. 

Topics will include BPC-focused materials and more general readings on topics
of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Participants are encouraged to suggest
possible readings through the [BPC Reading Group Material Suggestions Google
Form](https://forms.gle/wpvpW5gRVtDmMUnbA). For example, some readings from
the [Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions Resource
Pages](https://cahsi.utep.edu/resources/), may be of interest. 

The purpose of this group is to learn. We recognize no study or approach is
perfect. However, we strive to seek what we can learn from any reading despite
its limitations.

### Reading Group Mechanics

We will meet for one hour each week to discuss the week's reading. If the
group is sizable, we may split into breakout rooms for smaller discussions,
then reconvene to discuss points raised during those discussions.


- Meeting Time: Thursdays Noon, Utah Time
- Meeting Place: Zoom
 
Along with each discussion, we create a Perusall for cataloguing ideas and
discussion.  All people at the meeting are welcome to post. Anonymous posting
is permitted.

### Code of Conduct

The organizers reserve the right to remove people who are not being conducive
to an environment focused on broadening participation in computing. We will
ask anyone behaving in a fashion to leave first and revisit their
participation individually at a later date.

Participants are always free to leave any meeting at any point during the
meeting.

Participants who feel the environment is not conducive to broadening
participation are encouraged to reach out to the organizers. 

We will continue to revise these guidelines with feedback from the community.


### Notice of Mandatory Reporting

All organizers are considered mandatory reporters by the university. This
means that we are required to report observed or relayed incidents of
violence, harassment, abuse, sexual misconduct, discrimination, and crimes.
Furthermore, several other participants may also be mandatory reporters. If
you discuss these issues with them our us, either privately or in the reading
group, we must report them.

For confidential discussions of such matters that do not require reporting,
consider:
